An Omeka module for interfacing with JSTOR Forum.

This module enables Omeka to act as a JSTOR Forum publishing target.  To install the module just clone this repository into the Omeka plugins directory.

Refreshing the Omeka administration interface should reveal a new plugin in the available plugin list.  Install the plugin, and input a new token that will be shared with Forum.

To complete the link you will need the URL of the Omeka installation, and the token.

After configuration is complete, Omeka will appear as a publishing target inside Forum.
